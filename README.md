# barluath

A notation tool for the great highland bagpipe.  

A very simple GUI will allow opening and editing of plain text files.  These act as inputs to the typesetter in alanguage similar to the well known ABC language, but with some changes to optimise it for writing bagpipe music.

The GUI (written in wxPython) will display SVGs and export PDFs.

Roadmap:

1. write a very basic parser - a simple, incomplete parser has been written
2. Build GUI - a skeleton has been produced
3. Typesetter
4. PDF export
5. ????
6. Profit

The code is not at present licensed until any requirements from included libraries become clear, though the intent is that it will be GPL or similar.
